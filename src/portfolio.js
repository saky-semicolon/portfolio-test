        "This study investigates the use of AI-driven workload optimization as a strategic strategy for improving employee well-being and productivity in Malaysia, consequently promoting long-term economic growth consistent with SDG 8. As Malaysian firms prioritize creating employment and economic growth, and the study highlights the significance of artificial intelligence in transforming the dynamics of the workplace. In addition, AI technology may help organizations increase resource allocation, reduce operating costs, and improve employee job satisfaction. The study uses a qualitative research methodology, which includes semi-structured interviews with managers from six different firms that have implemented AI technologies. This approach provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of AI on employee experiences and organizational performance. Furthermore, the study shows the significance of focusing on strengths development approaches that promote a supportive work environment, eventually contributing to professional as well as personal goals. Furthermore, successful implementation of artificial intelligence requires active employee participation, which helps these technologies enrich rather than reduce the abilities of humans. The thematic analysis indicates an obvious connection between effective AI use and improved employee health, job happiness, and work-life balance, all of which contribute to greater productivity and workplace morale. However, the study acknowledges limitations due to its concentrated attention on a small number of businesses, emphasizing the need for more research across many different sectors. Finally, this study recommends a balanced approach that focuses on both technological innovation and employee well-being, which is essential to Malaysia‚Äôs economic growth and sustainability in the face of rapid technological advancement and increasing employee requirements.This paper presents a novel approach using deep learning algorithms for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease based on neuroimaging data.",

        "This study analyses cybersecurity techniques to improve employee safety within the framework of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements. As organizations focus more on digital infrastructure, the risks of cyber threats have risen, impacting both operational efficiency and employee well-being. The research project analyses and evaluates current cybersecurity measures, such as multi-layered security protocols and employee training, using qualitative interviews with representatives from nine companies. The findings demonstrate that companies implementing strong cybersecurity measures significantly decrease employee anxiety and stress about digital risks. Moreover, employees reported feeling safer and supported when their employers established effective cybersecurity methods, which created a culture of paying attention and awareness. In addition, the study highlights the psychological effects of cybersecurity responsibilities, suggesting that pressure to address digital risks can lead to higher mental health challenges for employees. As a result, the study recommends OSHA include digital security measures in its workplace safety standards to address these high risks. Despite its contributions, the study has limitations that focus on specific industries, which may disrupt the findings' generalization ability. Future studies must include a larger range of industries to gain a deeper knowledge of cybersecurity's impact on employee safety in different organizational situations. Overall, the findings emphasize the need for proactive cybersecurity measures to create a positive work environment. By bridging the gap between technological advancements in security and employee well-being, this study contributes to the increasing conversation on workplace safety in digital threats, emphasizing the need for robust legal structures that address both physical and digitall threats.",

        "Workplace safety and health (WSH) are increasingly recognized as vital components of organizational success, particularly in high-risk sectors such as manufacturing and construction in Malaysia. Despite the existence of comprehensive regulations like OSHA 1994, many companies still struggle with inadequate safety practices, leading to frequent accidents and costly disruptions. This research addresses the gap in the literature regarding the direct relationship between effective WSH practices and business outcomes, particularly in terms of profitability and productivity. The primary objective of this study is to investigate how hazard identification and risk mitigation strategies can enhance organizational performance. To achieve this, a qualitative methodology was employed, involving semi-structured interviews with safety managers, HR personnel, and compliance officers from six organizations. The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between comprehensive safety protocols and improved business performance. Companies that prioritize WSH report enhanced employee morale, reduced absenteeism, and increased productivity. Furthermore, organizations with strong safety cultures experience lower turnover rates and substantial cost savings from decreased insurance claims and legal fees. The implications of this research are profound, suggesting that businesses must integrate WSH as a core element of their operational strategy. By doing so, organizations comply with regulations and gain a competitive advantage in the market. This study highlights that investing in workplace safety is not merely a legal obligation but a strategic imperative that drives long-term success and sustainability in the evolving industrial landscape of Malaysia.",
