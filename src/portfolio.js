        "Workplace safety and health (WSH) are increasingly recognized as vital components of organizational success, particularly in high-risk sectors such as manufacturing and construction in Malaysia. Despite the existence of comprehensive regulations like OSHA 1994, many companies still struggle with inadequate safety practices, leading to frequent accidents and costly disruptions. This research addresses the gap in the literature regarding the direct relationship between effective WSH practices and business outcomes, particularly in terms of profitability and productivity. The primary objective of this study is to investigate how hazard identification and risk mitigation strategies can enhance organizational performance. To achieve this, a qualitative methodology was employed, involving semi-structured interviews with safety managers, HR personnel, and compliance officers from six organizations. The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between comprehensive safety protocols and improved business performance. Companies that prioritize WSH report enhanced employee morale, reduced absenteeism, and increased productivity. Furthermore, organizations with strong safety cultures experience lower turnover rates and substantial cost savings from decreased insurance claims and legal fees. The implications of this research are profound, suggesting that businesses must integrate WSH as a core element of their operational strategy. By doing so, organizations comply with regulations and gain a competitive advantage in the market. This study highlights that investing in workplace safety is not merely a legal obligation but a strategic imperative that drives long-term success and sustainability in the evolving industrial landscape of Malaysia.",

This research investigates the reasons for mass distrust and the rise of alternative media. Based on in-depth interviews with media professionals, this study found that state censorship, political interference, and a lack of transparency were some of the key reasons behind the collapse of public confidence in traditional media outlets. This study looks at the origins of mass distrust, and the resulting new media. The study, in a series of in-depth interviews with media practitioners, chose to identify some of the reasons behind general mistrust and the growth of new forms of media. It found control by the government over the press and political interference in editorial policy as major stumbling blocks for credibility among common people. Results have shown a marked drift towards social media and independent news channels, perceived to be more credible. This transition of traditional media to new media depicted an increasing demand of the public for accuracy and impartiality in Bangladesh. The study identifies comprehensive media reform as a key requirement to enhance transparency and independence within the media sector-a need also relevant to post-Hasina Bangladesh. Such changes are very important in building public self-confidence and making sure news organizations are free from unjustified political influence. The results will give valuable recommendations for policymakers and news houses on how to build and sustain reputable media arenas in Bangladesh.",

      abstract:
        "For the diagnosis and treatment of vision-threatening conditions such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration, precise retinal layer segmentation in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential. Despite their high technical accuracy, automated deep learning techniques frequently lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Meanwhile, manual segmentation remains time-consuming and inconsistent. The black-box nature of conventional models, pathological distortions, and image noise are major obstacles. An improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for automated, interpretable retinal layer segmentation is proposed in this work. Architectural innovations such as modified pooling strategies were integrated to enhance feature extraction from noisy OCT images. To address class imbalance and improve thin layer segmentation, a hybrid loss function that combines categorical Cross-Entropy and Dice Loss was developed. Crucially, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated into the pipeline to provide visual explanations of the model's decision-making process, enabling clinical validation. The model was trained and validated on the publicly available Duke OCT dataset. The proposed framework demonstrated high performance, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.77%, Dice Coefficient of 0.9446, and Jaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951, indicating robust and accurate segmentation across diverse scans. Class-wise analysis confirmed strong performance for most layers, though challenges remained for thinner layers with complex boundaries. Grad-CAM visualizations successfully highlighted anatomically relevant regions influencing segmentation decisions, confirming the model's alignment with clinical biomarkers and enhancing transparency. Using an Explainable AI (XAI) technique (Grad-CAM), a customized loss function, and architectural improvements, this study offers a strong SegNet-based framework that significantly enhances automated retinal layer segmentation. The model bridges the gap between algorithmic performance and clinical utility by achieving high accuracy while maintaining crucial interpretability. This approach holds significant potential for standardizing OCT analysis, improving diagnostic efficiency, and fostering trust in AI-driven ophthalmic tools.",

Precise energy forecasts balance grid stability while improving energy distribution and decreasing power plant utilization. Our existing forecasting methods have known problems that limit their performance across diverse regions and current power networks. The research examines how machine learning technologies impact renewable energy development in the power industry. Supervised learning models such as ANNs and SVMs, are explored for their predictive capabilities. Both PCA and K-Means clustering are evaluated for their effectiveness in handling feature extraction and trend analysis. Our research studies how Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and other reinforcement learning systems optimize energy management. Research proves that machine learning systems boost how accurately they predict trends and make the overall power grid work better. However, system functions with high data requirements plus limited ways to scale remain major issues in this field. Our findings show that new algorithms and better data systems are necessary to support current energy systems in efficient power distribution. Our energy grid and long-term forecasting depend on filling these gaps as part of our drive toward sustainable power systems.",

        "Accurate and interpretable HER2 IHC scoring is essential in the treatment of breast cancer, yet manual evaluation is inconsistent and subjective. This study proposes a two-deep learning model framework incorporating a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a fine-tuned DenseNet121 model for automated HER2 scoring from histopathological whole slide images. Preprocessing involves HSV-based patch filtering and expert validation to ensure data relevance. To improve transparency and address the black-box nature of AI models, explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are employed to provide visual explanations at the pixel and region levels. These techniques offer interpretability, ensuring clinical confidence by clearly visualizing and attributing model decisions, particularly in borderline HER2 cases (Class 1+ and 2+), where manual misinterpretations often occur. The experimental results show that both CNN and DenseNet121 achieved 0.93% accuracy with excellent class-wise consistency, while CNN delivered better confidence calibration and lower loss. Integration of explainability modules ensures improved clinical transparency, particularly for borderline HER2 classes, enhancing decision-making trust in AI models. Comparison of the assessment with the existing literature confirms the strength of the proposed method in predictive capacity and interpretability, contributing to a robust AI-assisted breast cancer diagnosis.",

      abstract:
        "In a well growing and fast-moving organization, presenting work should be smart and emphasized looking. Proposed Model HRbSBM will provide a cozy environment to the researchers, teachers, students, and industry persons for the presentation, and it will be beneficial for school level education system where the high-cost equipment is not affordable. This proposed model (HRbSBM) will also be beneficial for those teachers who cannot stand and cannot use the white board for explanation. By using their hand gesture, they can educate the students. During the presentation, changing the presentation, drawing something on the screen, and controlling the computer is no more headache with the help of the HRbSBM. It will be able to use a hand gesture to control its computer. In the conventional method, a wireless pen or remote is provided to the presenting person and that helps to change the presentation only, while with the help of the proposed model (HRbSBM ) no such gadgets are required to control it. This model not only helps during the presentation but also helps to control the computer for creating a presentation, creating graphs, and to write on screen as well. This HRbSBM will help school, college, and university students to learn in a better way and will aid teachers to present their work in a better way.",

    //     "Renewable energy forecasting is critical for managing the variability and intermittency of sources such as solar and wind, which are essential for transitioning to sustainable energy systems. Precise energy forecasts balance grid stability while improving energy distribution and decreasing power plant utilization. Our existing forecasting methods have known problems that limit their performance across diverse regions and current power networks. The research examines how machine learning technologies impact renewable energy development in the power industry. Supervised learning models such as ANNs and SVMs, are explored for their predictive capabilities. Both PCA and K-Means clustering are evaluated for their effectiveness in handling feature extraction and trend analysis. Our research studies how Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and other reinforcement learning systems optimize energy management. Research proves that machine learning systems boost how accurately they predict trends and make the overall power grid work better. However, system functions with high data requirements plus limited ways to scale remain major issues in this field. Our findings show that new algorithms and better data systems are necessary to support current energy systems in efficient power distribution. Our energy grid and long-term forecasting depend on filling these gaps as part of our drive toward sustainable power systems.",
